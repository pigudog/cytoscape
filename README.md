# cytoscape
 The github repository was originally set up to complete a course assignment for the “Introduction to Bioinformatics” course in the fall of 2023. 
 
 In order to better understand and build network diagrams, the author starts with the introduction of the use of Cytoscape software, and at the same time, a deeper exploration of Python, R, and network diagram visualization is carried out

# Introduction
The Cytoscape used in this manual is built on the 3.x architecture, with developer apps and user controls enabled. This release is the first version I have used as a class assignment, and the software and documentation will continue to be tweaked and improved in future releases.

This manual will cover the installation of Cytoscape, using common plugins, and how to use related websites and R for web exploration. If you dislike using the PDF version, you can also access the web version. This manual-related code and data uploaded: [github](https://github.com/pigudog/cytoscape).

> Although this manual provides a detailed introduction to installing and using Cytoscape, as well as a further supplement for network mapping, to get a more complete understanding of Cytoscape and its ecosystem, and to use the latest version of the software, I recommend reading the **Welcome Letter** on [https://cytoscape.org](https://cytoscape.org)
